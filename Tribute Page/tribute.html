            <p class="ad">
                I deeply admire Jawaharlal Nehru's unwavering commitment to India's
                independence and his relentless pursuit of justice. His eloquence and
                leadership during the Indian independence movement were truly inspiring.
                Nehru's dedication to democracy, secularism, and social justice laid the
                foundation for a modern, diverse, and inclusive India that I admire
                today.

            <br />
            <p class="bio">
                Jawaharlal Nehru, fondly known as
                <strong>"Pandit Nehru,"</strong>
                was born on November 14, 1889, in Allahabad, India, into a distinguished
                family with a rich legacy of political involvement. His father,<strong>
                Motilal Nehru</strong>, was a prominent lawyer, and his mother,
                <strong>Swarup Rani Nehru</strong>, was deeply rooted in Indian
                traditions. After India gained independence on August 15, 1947,
                Jawaharlal Nehru assumed the role of the country's first Prime Minister,
                appointed by <strong>Lord Mountbatten</strong>, the last British Viceroy
                of India. Jawaharlal Nehru passed away on May 27, 1964, in New Delhi,
                leaving behind a legacy of leadership, democratic values, and a vision
                of a modern, secular, and industrialized India. His birthday, November
                14, is celebrated as <strong>Children's Day</strong> in India, reflecting his deep
                affection for children and his commitment to their well-being.
